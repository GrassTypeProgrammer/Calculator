1) Done. screen css needs work.
2) Done. backspace.
3) Done. pressing equals twice will cause undefined to show.
4) Done. float values don't currently work. (will need backspace adjustment)
5) Done. staring with a symbol causes an error. The only symbol you should be able to start with is a - (will need backspace adjustment)
6) JS handles it for me. Prevent divide by 0/ handle it gracefully.
7) Done. Make unused buttons disabled.
8) New color scheme.
9) Screen update:
    needs padding on right.
    make input start from left so that it truncates the decimal. Ie; currently, if you have 2.9999999999, the 2.9 get cut off
        from the left and you see 99999999, which appears to be an error.
9) finished.
